This directory contains the PAES test suite; in order to run it you need to
have the PAES source code in ../paes and the reference serial AES implementation
source code in ../aes; you also need a correctly installed OpenCL SDK and
a fairly recent version of Python 2 (2.6 or more is surely good).

The test executable files are the following:

   * test_bijectivity.py: checks if applying PAES respects the relation
       decrypt(encrypt(data)) = data;
       
   * test_conformance.py: checks if PAES is conformant to the serial AES
       reference implementation;
       
   * test_file_size.py: checks if PAES works well with different input file
       sizes;
       
   * test_performance.py: measures PAES performances.
   
Each test executable accepts "cpu" or "gpu" as argument; for example, to test
PAES performances on your GPU you could use the following command line:

$ ./test_performance.py gpu

The test results will be logged into files under the report/ directory (it will
be created if non-existant). The random data generated for the tests will be put
in a directory named temp-something/, where "something" is the name of the test
that you're running; if the test will end correctly than such directory will be
automatically deleted, otherwise it will be left untouched to allow further 
analysis.
